Redmine Issue Reminder
==============

Plugin provides an easy to use interface to set up automatic email reminder to every project. 
Every reminder uses a custom query with all their filter options to select issues 
and performs periodical email transmission on a role basis.

Following intervals are possible:
 - Daily (Selecting interval from every 1st day until every 6th day)
 - Weekly (Selecting weekday)
 - Monthly (Selecting day of the month)

## Installation - Linux

Download the sources and put them to your vendor/plugins folder.

    $ cd {REDMINE_ROOT}/plugins
    $ git clone https://github.com/Hopebaytech/redmine_issue_reminder.git

Install required gem for plugin

    $ bundle install

Migrate database.

    $ rake db:migrate:plugins

(See also http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Plugins )    

For the periodical transmission a daily cron job has to be created:
      
    $ sudo crontab -e
    0 6 * * * cd {REDMINE_ROOT} && rake reminder:exec RAILS_ENV="production" > /dev/null 2>&1
    
Restart Redmine

Run Redmine and have a fun!

The reminder functionality can be activated in each project as module and can be configured through the project menu entry "Reminder Settings".
A special right needs to be configured in order to allow project member to edit reminder.

## Testing redminder mail

## Troubleshouting

### How can i customize the queries?

Take a look at the official documentation about custom queries: 
http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineIssueList#Custom-queries

### I don't see the Reminder Settings

Add permission to Your user.

### The issue reminder doesn't send mails

We use redmine internal mail send functions, therefore the outgoing email settings 
has to be set in config/emai.yml or config/configuration.yml

### I can not use the windows scheduler (WinXP related)

You need to have a user password set for your windows user in order to use the windows scheduler.
