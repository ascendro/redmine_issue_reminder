Redmine Issue Reminder
==============

[Plugin page on redmine.org](http://www.redmine.org/plugins/redmine_mail_reminder)

Compatible with redmine 3.3, 3.2

redmine 3.4 is not tested yet.

Plugin provides an easy to use interface to set up automatic email reminder to every project. 
Every reminder uses a custom query with all their filter options to select issues 
and performs periodical email transmission on a role basis.

Following intervals are possible:
 - Daily (Selecting interval from every 1st day until every 6th day)
 - Weekly (Selecting weekday)
 - Monthly (Selecting day of the month)

## Migrate from redmine_issue_reminder to redmine_mail_reminder

At 2015/05/13 (2.6/3.0 Branch) this plugin is renamed from redmine_issue_reminder to redmine_mail_reminder, in order to avoid conflict with [existed redmine_issue_reminder](http://www.redmine.org/plugins/redmine_issue_reminder).

* Rename your redmine_issue_reminder directory (redmine/plugins/redmine_issue_reminder) to redmine_mail_reminder

* Connect to your redmine's SQL database, run the following SQL script
	```sql
	update schema_migrations set version=replace(version, 'redmine_issue_reminder', 'redmine_mail_reminder') where version like '%redmine_issue_reminder%';
	update settings set name=replace(name, 'issue', 'mail') where name =  'plugin_redmine_issue_reminder';
	```

* Pull new version source from github

* Install dependencies and migrate database
	```console
	cd redmine/
	bundle install
	RAILS_ENV=production rake redmine:plugins:migrate
	```
7. Restart your web server (usually /etc/init.d/apache2 restart)

## Installation - Linux

* Clone this repository into ```redmine/plugins/redmine_mail_reminder```
* Install dependencies and migrate database
	```console
	cd redmine/
	bundle install
	RAILS_ENV=production rake redmine:plugins:migrate
	```

* Setup cronjob for daily transmission. RVM users see [Using RVM with Cron](https://rvm.io/deployment/cron).
	```
	crontab -e
	# Check reminders at 06:00 every day, send emails by schedule
	0 6 * * * cd redmine/ && rake reminder:exec RAILS_ENV="production"
	# Or, Check reminders at 08:30 on work days 1-6, send emails by schedule
	30 8 * * 1-6 cd redmine/ && rake reminder:exec RAILS_ENV="production"
	```
CentOS users can make a file /etc/cron.d/redmine
	```
	SHELL=/bin/bash
	PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
	MAILTO=root
	HOME=/
	#check reminders at 06:00 every day, send emails by schedule
	0 6 * * * root cd /var/lib/redmine && /usr/local/bin/rake reminder:exec RAILS_ENV="production" >> 	/var/lib/redmine/log/production.log 2>&1
	```
and restart cron with 
	```
	/etc/init.d/crond restart
	```
* Restart your Redmine web server (e.g. mongrel, thin, mod_rails)

## Installation - Windows

Enviroment : Winxp + Redmine 1.2.X + Mysql 5.X
 
* Write a bat file such as these
	```bat
	echo on
	cd redmine\
	rake reminder:exec RAILS_ENV="production"
	```

* Config a schedule following  http://www.iopus.com/guides/winscheduler.htm
* Restart redmine server.

## Configuration

* Active `Issue reminder` module in project settings
* Configure `View issue reminder` in "Administration > Roles and permissions"
* Create a [custom query](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineIssueList#Custom-queries) of what you want to send in email.
* Create reminder with custom query in "Project > Issues Reminder"
 
## Testing redminder mail

Send test mail without affecting inverval of schedule

```rake reminder:exec[test] RAILS_ENV="production"```

* The behavior of `rake reminder:exec` is to send email only if it is time to send a new email, regarding the interval parameters. If you execute `rake reminder:exec` manually, it will affact next scheduled transmission.
* `rake reminder:exec[test]` is supposed to have exactly the same behavior as `rake reminder:exec`, except two things:
	* It does always send emails to issue assignees (no matter when the last execution was)
	* It does not affecting the next schedule of `rake reminder:exec`.

## Troubleshouting

Make sure that:

1. You are using the branch which matches your redmine version. e.g. redmine2.0/redmine2.5/redmine2.6/master for lastest version
2. This plugin folder's name is redmine_**mail**_reminder
3. Your cron job executes without errors

### How can i customize the queries?

Take a look at the official documentation about custom queries: 
http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineIssueList#Custom-queries

### I don't see the Reminder Settings

Add permission to Your user.

### The issue reminder doesn't send mails

We use redmine internal mail send functions, therefore the outgoing email settings 
has to be set in config/emai.yml or config/configuration.yml

### I can not use the windows scheduler (WinXP related)

You need to have a user password set for your windows user in order to use the windows scheduler. See also here: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc785125(WS.10).aspx
