[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Hopebaytech/redmine_issue_reminder](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/Hopebaytech/redmine_issue_reminder?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Compatible with redmine 2.6.1.stable

Plugin provides an easy to use interface to set up automatic email reminder to every project. 
Every reminder uses a custom query with all their filter options to select issues 
and performs periodical email transmission on a role basis.

Following intervals are possible:
 - Daily (Selecting interval from every 1st day until every 6th day)
 - Weekly (Selecting weekday)
 - Monthly (Selecting day of the month)

## Installation - Linux

Download the sources and put them to your vendor/plugins folder.

```console
$ cd {REDMINE_ROOT}/plugins
$ git clone https://github.com/Hopebaytech/redmine_issue_reminder.git
```

Install required gem for plugin

```console
$ bundle install
```

Install plugin and update DB

```console
$ rake redmine:plugins:migrate
```

(See also http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Plugins )    

For the periodical transmission a daily cron job has to be created:

If you use system ruby:

```console
$ sudo crontab -e
0 6 * * * cd {REDMINE_ROOT} && rake reminder:exec RAILS_ENV="production" > /dev/null 2>&1
```

If you use RVM:
```console 
$ sudo crontab -e
0 6 * * * {REDMINE_ROOT}/script/mail_reminder.sh > /dev/null 2>&1
```

```console 
$ vim {REDMINE_ROOT}/script/mail_reminder.sh
#!/bin/bash
source {USER_HOME}/.rvm/scripts/rvm
export PATH="$PATH:{USER_HOME}/.rvm/bin"
cd {REDMINE_ROOT}
rake reminder:exec RAILS_ENV=production
```

Restart Redmine

Run Redmine and have a fun!

The reminder functionality can be activated in each project as module and can be configured through the project menu entry "Reminder Settings".
A special right needs to be configured in order to allow project member to edit reminder.

## Installation - Windows

Enviroment : Winxp + Redmine 1.2.X + Mysql 5.X
 
 1. Write a bat file such as these

```bat
echo on
cd {REDMINE_ROOT}
rake reminder:exec RAILS_ENV="production"
```

 2. config a schedule just follow this

 3. then start the redmine server.
 
## Testing redminder mail

To send test mail without inverval check:

```console
rake reminder:exec[test]
```

 `rake reminder:exec[test]` is supposed to have exactly the same behavior as `rake reminder:exec` except two things :
 
* it does always send emails (no matter when the last execution was)
* it does not update the last execution date

The behavior of `rake reminder:exec` is to send email only if it is time to send a new email, regarding the interval parameters and the `rake reminder:exec[test]` is supposed to send email each times it is executed with a non empty body.

## Troubleshouting

### How can i customize the queries?

Take a look at the official documentation about custom queries: 
http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineIssueList#Custom-queries

### I don't see the Reminder Settings

Add permission to Your user.

### The issue reminder doesn't send mails

We use redmine internal mail send functions, therefore the outgoing email settings 
has to be set in config/emai.yml or config/configuration.yml

### I can not use the windows scheduler (WinXP related)

You need to have a user password set for your windows user in order to use the windows scheduler.
